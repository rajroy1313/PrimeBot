## Project Architecture

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Main database for persistent data
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Located in `shared/schema.ts`
  - `live_polls`: Poll metadata and settings
  - `live_poll_options`: Poll choices and vote counts
  - `live_poll_votes`: Individual vote records
